# Upgrading from version 2.X.X to version 3.X.X

## MapSet

Prior to version **2.2.0**, **ex_aws_dynamo** was encoding **MapSet** data into one of the three Dynamo set types (number, string, and binary), but was decoding those types into Elixir **List** data. In version **2.2.0**, a PR added a boolean configuration option, `:decode_sets`, that would allow the user to specify that these types should be decoded into **MapSet** as well.

In this major release, Dynamo set types decode to Elixir **MapSet** by default, so the `:decode_sets` configuration option can be removed if it was included. If it this option was not included or was explicitly set to `false`, you'll need to be prepared to handle any decoded Dynamo sets as **MapSet** instead of **List**.

## Jason

Several months ago, `ex_aws` switched its default JSON codec from **Poison** to **Jason** (see https://github.com/ex-aws/ex_aws/pull/658). In this major release, the encoder used for `dev` and `test` environments has been changed to **Jason**, and the README file has been updated to show **Jason** in use instead of **Poison**, and refers the user to the `ex_aws` docs for information about how to provide a custom JSON codec.
